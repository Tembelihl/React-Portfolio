              My goal when I created this Mzamomtsha Primary School website was
              to create a website that will be User-friendly and accessible to
              all users, including students, teachers, parents, and the general
              public. Up-to-date with the latest information about the school,
              functional and easy to use.

              to share information and ideas,to allow people to stay connected
              with friends and family and also to entertain and engage users.

              accessible to people who are not familiar with them, to save
              people time and effort when doing financial calculations and to
              provide a platform for people to share financial information.
